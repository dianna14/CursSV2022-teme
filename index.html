                    <p>My favorite animal is the dog because it is intelligent, playful and I consider it to be man's best friend. They are smart and they like games that make them think. For example, the dogs would appreciate you hiding cookies around the house for them to find, giving them smart toys to play with, and taking them to new places so they have novel environs to explore. If you have a dog you are lucky and safe!</p>
